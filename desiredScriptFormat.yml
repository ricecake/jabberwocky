It should be possible to add a simple parser to the shared utils library, that will just slurp all the contents between '---' and parse it as yaml, and then pass the rest as the script body.

Specifically, it should parse from the first '---' to the second '---', each alone on one line, ignoring whitespace.  That way, it should be possible to enter:
/*** Metadata ***
---
stuff: things
more stuff: further things!
---
****************/

so that the files can end in .js, and syntax highlighters wont freakout.

Should also make sure to keep the before part, just for safety.  Or maybe it should just be '/*---' to '---*/'? to make it easy, and the first one needs to be on the first line?
Or I'm overthinkign this all, and just use the --- and be done with it all.

Need to write a function that can edit/manipulate the metadata in the file header, without changing the rest of the body.  That way the sign function can append the signature, and who did the signing, and when.
